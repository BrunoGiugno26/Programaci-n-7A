            <h3>Skills</h3>
         <p>
            There are distinct areas of skill upgradability including maximum health, listen mode distance, crafting speed, healing speed, weapon sway, and shiv mastery.
            Each skill has a limit on the number of times it can upgraded. For instance, crafting speed and healing speed may be upgraded three times each, but maximum health and weapon sway may only be upgraded two times. These upgrades use supplements found or earned around the game world.

    <p>Ellie is the most important person in this game, because all game turn around her.She is very smart in your fights, she uses stealth very well. Also at the same time as abby knows make some guns for example molotov bombs for the floors (these explosives are very important for the infected and the enemies).</p>
<p>When the finale of the game is close, for be more specific in Santa Barbara, Ellie found a wonderful machine gun called mp5, but the best weapon is her knife, not because of the damage, but because of its affective value since it belongs to her mother</p>
